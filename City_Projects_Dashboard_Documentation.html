    <h1>City Projects Dashboard Documentation</h1>
    <p>This document explains the structure and meaning of the data used in the City Projects Dashboard. This dashboard provides 
    insights into various city projects, including their status, budget, feedback, and other key metrics, to help track 
    progress and resources effectively.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>1. Project Overview</h2>
        <p>The "Project Overview" section provides key information about each project in the city, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Project Name</strong>: The name or identifier for each city project (e.g., Project A, Project B).</li>
            <li><strong>Status</strong>: The current state of the project, categorized as:
                <ul>
